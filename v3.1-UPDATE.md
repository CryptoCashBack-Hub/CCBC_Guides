# v3.1.0 IPSUM Mandatory Network Upgrade Guide

## Linux VPS

If you've used CryptoNeverSleeps IPSUM Linux Installation script, he has provided an easy to use upgrade guide [here](UPDATE-SCRIPT.md)

### Connect to your Linux VPS over SSH

  * Use your favorite terminal application on Linux or Putty/Bitvise clients on Windows
  * Connect to a terminal session with the Linux VPS

### Stop the IPSUM Linux Daemon

  * Change directory to the location you downloaded and unpacked ipsd and ips-cli
  * From the terminal session, run the following command
  ```
  ./ips-cli stop
  ```

### Remove the old IPSUM Linux Daemon

  * From the terminal session, run the following commands
  ```
  sudo rm ipsd
  sudo rm ips-cli
  sudo rm ips-qt
  ```

### Download, Install, and Run the v3.1.0 IPSUM Linux Daemon Release

  * From the terminal session, run the following command
  ```
  wget https://github.com/ipsum-network/ips/releases/download/v3.1.0.0/ips-3.1.0-linux.tar.gz
  ```

  * From the terminal session, run the following command
  ```
  tar -xvf ips-3.1.0-linux.tar.gz
  ```

  * From the terminal session, run the following command
  ```
  cd ips-3.1.0/bin/
  ```

  * From the terminal session, run the following command
  ```
  ./ipsd
  ```

### Check the IPSUM Linux Daemon 
*Now check that the daemon is in sync and display the proper version*

  * From the terminal session, run the following command
  ```
  ./ips-cli getinfo
  ```

  * Compare the "Block Height" value with the latest from the [IPSUM block explorer](https://explorer.ipsum.network/). When those are the same, your daemon is synchronized

  * Compare the version string displayed, if upgraded properly it will say ```"version" : 3010000```
